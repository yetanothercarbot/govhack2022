# Script for GovHack video

Greetings! I'm Wilko, this is my team member Bryan, and we are team Milk is Optional. Let's turn the clock back a few years to 2019. I was just graduating high school, [some major event], and Australia's eastern seaboard was being ravaged by bushfires. Walk into any supermarket, and you were greeted by an empty toilet paper aisle. Worse, entire towns and communities were cut off from vital supplies. The same trend is visible throughout 2020 - with panic buying before every lockdown - and last year's floods left towns stranded. 

Our road network is integral to Australia's supply corridors, and as such must have a high degree of resiliency. Our project - FreightRelocate - tackles National Freight Data Hub's challenge to improve this resiliency, by creating an overview of what regions have been prone to flooding in the past and are likely to be affected by bushfires in the future.

[Show some stuff about how it works]

We have larger plans for this, that we were not able to realise within the 46 hours of this competition.
